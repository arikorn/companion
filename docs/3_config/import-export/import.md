On the **Full import** tab, you can specify which categories you want to import. Clicking the "Reset and Import" button will reset the selected categories and then import those parts of the configuration.

Make sure to take an export of your current configuration first, in case you make a mistake.

The **Buttons** and **Triggers** tabs allow you to import a subset of the pages or triggers, and optionally remap the connections.
